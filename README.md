# 🐍 100 Days of Python – Core Programming + Geospatial Journey

Welcome to my 100-day coding journey where I'm combining two powerful learning paths:
- 👩‍🏫 [**100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023**](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) by Dr. Angela Yu  
- 🌍 *Introduction to GIS Programming* and other resources by Dr. Qiusheng Wu 

## 🎯 Goal

To build strong foundations in Python programming and apply those skills in **Remote Sensing** and **GIS (Geographic Information Systems)**.

Each day of this challenge will be stored in its own folder with:
- ✔️ Python code (`main.py`, Jupyter Notebooks, etc.)
- 📘 A `README.md` file with summaries, challenges, and reflections
