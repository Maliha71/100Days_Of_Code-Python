# Day 1 – Printing Practice (Dr. Angela Yu)

### 🧠 Challenge:
Write a Python program that uses print statements to output a 5-step recipe.  
The output **must exactly match** the example format including punctuation and spacing.

### ✅ Example Output:
1. Mix 500g of Flour, 10g Yeast and 300ml Water in a bowl.

2. Knead the dough for 10 minutes.

3. Add 3g of Salt.

4. Leave to rise for 2 hours.

5. Bake at 200 degrees C for 30 minutes.

### 🔍 How I Thought About It:

1. First, I carefully read and observed **what the problem is asking**.
2. It's asking to **print some text** to the screen → So I need to use the `print()` function.
3. What is the type of content I am printing? → It's all **strings**.
4. In Python, strings must be enclosed in **quotes** (`" "` or `' '`).
5. The formatting (spacing, punctuation, and capitalization) must match the **example exactly**.

### 💡 What I Learned:

- How to use the `print()` function to display text
- That spacing, punctuation, and formatting **must be exact** in programming challenges
- That reading the problem **carefully** saves time

### 💻 My Code:

```python
print("1. Mix 500g of Flour, 10g Yeast and 300ml Water in a bowl.")
print("2. Knead the dough for 10 minutes.")
print("3. Add 3g of Salt.")
print("4. Leave to rise for 2 hours.")
print("5. Bake at 200 degrees C for 30 minutes.")
